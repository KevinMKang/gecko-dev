# Diagnosis

Currently on Firefox Devtools, the Network tab allows you to block requests. These requests are editable in name, but they display a regular pointer cursor, and not a text cursor. This is a problem since it doesn't immediately let a user know that they can edit which requests they're blocking.

# Solution

The blocking label itself is a [JS item](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/3300072e993ae05d50d5c63d815260367eaf9179/devtools/client/netmonitor/src/components/request-blocking/RequestBlockingPanel.js#116) with associated [CSS selector](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/3300072e993ae05d50d5c63d815260367eaf9179/devtools/client/netmonitor/src/assets/styles/RequestBlockingPanel.css#29). The solution is to specify the text cursor within the CSS selector.

Testing was done using visual inspection. The top screenshot shows the currently bugged label, with a normal cursor. The fix in the bottom screenshot shows the change to a text cursor, fixing the issue.

Associated tests were run, with running tests at 
```
devtools/client/netmonitor/test/browser_net_block.js and browser_net_block-csp.js
```
